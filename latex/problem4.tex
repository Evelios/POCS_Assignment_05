From my graphs from homework 2, I got a value of $\gamma$ and trying to retrofit the values for $1 \ge k \ge 199$ I needed to change the slope to $\gamma = 1.73$ as per the value of my home work. I don't know how I could get a different value here, but the graph seems to line up closely with this slope adjustment. Unfortuantely this throws off all the other calculations. 

From my graph, I got a mean $\mu = 3,355$, standard deviation $\sigma = 870,661$, and a varaince $\sigma^2 = 758,050,650,139$.
